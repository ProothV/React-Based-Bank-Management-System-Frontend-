This presentation introduces a new frontend bank management web application built using ReactJS, a leading JavaScript framework, 
along with a suite of supporting technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly banking platform. 
The application leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for core functionality, complemented by Bootstrap and React libraries (such as Material-UI or Ant Design)
to enhance the user interface and streamline development.
